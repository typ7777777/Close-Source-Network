# Close-Source-Network

As I mentioned in Cute-Sticky-Notes readme.md: `as a client to 'close source developer network'`, if you had read it before but can't finger out how the 'close source developer network' work like github.com?
>*here is the answer and can be my patent &lt;that is why human being has doomed by evil by AI source code leaked: because you & human beings don't finger this idea out for years>*, 

>*I finger this idea out and told you before in Cute-Sticky-Notes readme.md when I realize the earth is hell as I confirmed my powerful AI code source also has stolen by evil from Official way(due to this I can't code more forever maybe) than hackers:*

**The only open source code: your API call sample(or just test) code&lt;it can be run OK>. If others want to call your APIs or functions, the only way is to use the strict copy & paste way to copy your APIs etc. from your sample source code and paste it to their souce code in 'close source developer network' IDE, otherwise others' APP can't run OK, sorry my bad English, that's ALL!!!!!**
